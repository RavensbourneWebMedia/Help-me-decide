# Notes

### 12.09

#### Presentation

* [x] `src` is not `scr` (maybe we have that as part of the *Spot the difference* activity)
* *Spot the difference* could also have missing or double `}}`
* Let them know at the beginning when they're going to have **breaks**, otherwise they get distressed and wet themselves.
* [x] Use the **sandwich analogy** to explain html tags
* [x] ~~Visuals for the building blocks of a comic may help in the presentation?~~
* [x] Need to find a smoother way to go from WEB (comic) to WWWTF? What is the Web in a nutshell, how it started and how does it work..

#### Hacktivity

* Explain that we're going to work on **content and structure first**, **then style** it. Show the final result, then a version without style. 
* Make sure people are using the same browser I'm using (not IE please).
* Explain the **DRY** principle when introducing CSS.
* A good coder is a **lazy coder**: **copy-paste** whenever you can, use **shortcuts**.
* Tell them that **positioning is tricky**, but understanding it will allow them to control their comic layout with extreme precision. 
* Point out that **position** is going to be the **trickiest** part of the session, maybe ask them to just look at me coding for a minute, and then try and reproduce the 3 steps (also commenting those steps in the CSS may help). Still can't find a good way to explain it. Maybe we re-introduce ` * { position: relative; } ` in the template? 
* always use **px**, not just 0
* [x] In the slide about **copy-hack**, maybe we loose the facebook thing (you can show it when we're introducing the web inspector) and instead say something like "copy me (before lunch), then hack it (after lunch)"
* [x] When I'm saying that "learning to code is like learning a new language", mention that **today** you're going to learn **2 new languages**
* Ask more **why** questions, ask students to explain what they're doing, to see if they understand what each line of code does.
* Ask people to **google for solutions**
* You can customise your **Tumblr**, maybe instead of talking about *makers vs consumers* I could make more practical examples of what they can do with what they'll learn today.
* If we set `top:50px;` and then `bottom:0px;` the speech bubble stretches over the height of its parent..
* When setting images with `position:absolute;` their parent section will collapse. A quick work-around is to set the parent's `height`
* If we start late, we're going to leave late.. so really is up to you.
* Later in the afternoon you can let them *code* [Flappy Bird](http://studio.code.org/flappy/1)
* Before students can leave they have to send their comic's link to me.
* People seem to like the browser-server illustrations, they find them *cute*.
* Make a point that everything you want people to see has to be within the `<body> </body>`.
* Didn't get to use **classes** at all today. Maybe `p.bubble` should be used instead of `section p`
* Explaining `id` attributes as a way to talk specifically to one person as opposed to all the class seemed to work well. Especially when I pointed at a random person and asked "What's your name?" 
* Maybe `class` could be used with a peoples' analogy, eg `class="male"`
* Switching between *panel* and *section* doesn't help, maybe just use `section`
* Stress that `_` at the end of the URL of their comic is super-important, cause if you don't put it you'll get confused and you'll cry.
