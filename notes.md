## Presentation

* Always rehearse the thing before, so that you don't have to rely on notes
* `Can you think of words that contain "code"?` We need an example here.. or perhaps a hint like `when you go to a party and you're asked to dress in a certain way, that's a ... code`, and the slide should be `...CODE`
* Use controldeck.js: it's useful so that you can walk around the room, and also you can use it as an example of open-source web technology
* Get rid of `what are you / computers good at?`
* `Are you a coder` **after** `Learn to code`? Or maybe get rid of it?
* `wwwtf` after `copy/hack`
* Get rid of `Web history` and `how does it work`?
* `Today` and `brief` all together (or get rid of `brief`)


## Apptivity

* CSS before JS, don't give people a choice
* Robot game works well!

## What's missing

* some interface design (to show the design process): paper template for people to sketch out ideas, and visualise interface elements and interaction flows
* breaking down the app behaviour (after the robot game)
* bit of JS noodling?


## Ideas

* Make a chatter-bot app, inspired by ShitDuolingoSays and Eliza?
* Make something with a voice API (Wit.ai)?
* Make something with the GeoLocation API?
* Make something with the Camera API?
* Make something with the Audio API?
