<h1>Presentation</h1>

<h2>What is code?</h2>

<p><strong>Where</strong> is code? Is there code in this (phone/computer/presentation..)</p>

<p>It's <strong>instructions</strong> to a computer: extremely powerful, fundamentally thick.</p>

<p>Imagine a computer is your most pedantic friend: <strong>break down</strong> every step, be <strong>precise</strong>, it will take you <strong>literally</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Spot the difference</li>
</ul>


<h2>Who is a coder?</h2>

<h3>Who makes code?</h3>

<p>Code is executed by <strong>machines</strong>, and written by <strong>people</strong>.</p>

<p>Misconception: coding is for people who really know what they're doing, who have code just flowing out of their brains..</p>

<p>Anyone who uses code to <strong>solve problems or make things</strong>, <em>creatively</em> and <em>collaboratively</em>.</p>

<p>A coder is someone like me, someone like you. <strong>I'm no computer scientist</strong>.</p>

<h2>How do you learn to code?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Any ideas?</li>
</ul>


<p>Like <strong>learning a new language</strong>, <strong>translating</strong> your ideas into code.</p>

<p>A bit of <strong>grammar</strong> and <strong>vocabulary</strong>, and mostly you can learn by <strong>copying</strong></p>

<h3>Copy</h3>

<p>If you want to learn typography, you start copying and <strong>editing</strong> fonts.</p>

<p>If you want to become a pattern cutter, you <strong>deconstruct</strong> and copy good garments.</p>

<p>If you want to make things on the Web, you <strong>inspect</strong> and copy good websites.</p>

<ul>
<li>Here's Facebook, your favourite website.</li>
<li>Let's <strong>inspect</strong> it.</li>
<li>Let's <strong>hack</strong> it (change <code>.loggedout_menubar_container</code>).</li>
</ul>


<p>This is something we're going to dig in later on.</p>

<h2>Can you learn to code in a day?</h2>

<ul>
<li>What do you think?</li>
</ul>


<p>Today is not about becoming proficient coders (although this could be your starting point), but rather to become <strong>confident in tinkering with code</strong>.</p>

<p>To see code as a <strong>toolbox</strong>, and not something scary or too complex for you.</p>

<p>To see the <strong>Web</strong> as a place where you can <strong>make</strong> things and not just <strong>consume</strong> them.</p>

<h2>Today</h2>

<p>You will make a <strong>Web comic</strong>.</p>

<p>I will show you a few <strong>coding tricks</strong> and we'll lay the <strong>foundations</strong> of your Web comic together.</p>

<p>Then you will explore the <strong>potential of the Web</strong>, and experiment with the <strong>visual language</strong> of a comic.</p>

<p>It will be up to you to <em>fill in the gaps</em>, and bring your Web comic to life.</p>

<h2>What is a Web comic?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Any ideas?</li>
</ul>


<p>(conservative) It's a comic, on the Web.</p>

<p>It's <strong>more</strong> than that.</p>

<h2>What is a Web (comic)?</h2>

<p>The Web is not the Internet. If the Internet is a global <em>brain</em> (infrastructure), the Web is all the <em>memories</em> and <em>thoughts</em> that run on top o it.</p>

<p>The WWW started as a bunch of images and text linked together, over <strong>2 computers in Switzerland</strong>.
A special kind of text, aka <strong>hypertext</strong> because it's linked together by <strong>hyperlinks</strong>.</p>

<h2>How does the WWW work?</h2>

<p>(Image of <em>browser</em> and <em>server</em>, with <em>HTTP</em> and <em>HTML</em> in between)</p>

<p>The <strong>browser</strong> is your waiter, takes an HTTP request from you and sends it to the Internet, to find a resource/page/site that responds to your request.</p>

<p>If you haven't mistyped your request, this will reach a server on the other end.</p>

<p>A <strong>server</strong> is a computer that is always on. Receives requests and cooks responses, which are sent back to the browser as <strong>HTML code</strong>.</p>

<h3>HTML</h3>

<p>What does HTML stand for?</p>

<ul>
<li>Any ideas?</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Markup</strong> is the key word here.</p>

<p>As humans we <strong>understand information visually</strong> (eg big/small text in a magazine), but computers/browsers don't. So we need to <strong>mark our content up</strong>, ie tell the browser "This is an image, this a paragraph, this is a title, this is a section etc."</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Follow me on Twitter&lt;/p&gt;

then

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="//twitter.com/baddeo"&gt;Follow me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Anything between angle brackets is instructions for the browser.</p>

<p>P is a shortcut for <em>paragraph</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>What other tags do you know?</li>
</ul>


<h2>What is a (Web) comic?</h2>

<p>It's a <strong>sequence</strong> of images and text that are <strong>linked</strong> together (bit like the Web).</p>

<p>Mostly to tell a <strong>story</strong> (starts somewhere sometimes, things happen, happy or sad ending).</p>

<h3>What is your story?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Who are you?</li>
<li>What interests you?</li>
<li>What do you stand for?</li>
</ul>


<h2>What is a/your Web comic?</h2>

<p>On the <strong>Web</strong>, you can have <strong>more</strong> than images and text: embed video, audio &amp; animation, you can get people to <strong>draw</strong> instead of just <strong>read</strong> (e.g. maps, drawing canvas), social media feeds and buttons...</p>

<p>A <strong>comic is <em>not just</em> about telling stories</strong>: communicate <strong>ideas</strong>, express <strong>opinions</strong>, raise <strong>awareness</strong>, present <strong>projects</strong>..</p>

<p>Your Web comic could become a <strong>storyboard</strong>, a <strong>lookbook</strong>, and <strong>interactive poster</strong>, an online <strong>magazine</strong>, a blog <strong>post</strong>. It’s really up to you.</p>

<h2>Become Web-literate</h2>

<p>By making a Web comic today, you will get to know the <strong>fabrics</strong> of the Web (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), and become <strong>confident</strong> to use code to <strong>express your ideas creatively</strong>.</p>

<p>I don't expect you to become a skilled coder. You may want to become a fashion designer, or a ...</p>

<p>However as a <strong>creative professional in the 21st century you can’t be Web-illiterate</strong>. Just like you have to be able to read and write, and do some maths. You need to understand a bit of code.</p>

<p>Being Web-literate will enable you to use the Web as an open platform, a place where you can be a <strong>maker</strong>, instead of a <strong>consumer</strong>.</p>

<h1>Notes</h1>

<h5>10.09</h5>

<ul>
<li><p>Should explain the difference between HTML and CSS before we start coding? Maybe there should also be a slide for CSS?</p></li>
<li><p>[x] Instead of <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> show <code>&lt;a&gt;</code></p></li>
<li><p>[x] <em>Spot the difference</em> at the beginning of the presentation, when talking about <em>what is code</em> and the pedantic friend analogy.</p></li>
<li><p>Do we need to end with the <em>Become Web-literate</em> slide? Or perhaps something more practical, like</p>

<p>  <em>Go online, find Webmaker and sign up.</em></p></li>
<li><p>I don't want to discourage people from asking questions, but some of them I can postpone to answer later. Maybe make the rules clear at the beginning of the coding session.</p>

<p>  <em>If you're <strong>getting stuck</strong> or falling behind, please tell me straight away. Sometimes it's just a matter of a missing semi-colon or so..</em></p>

<p>  <em>If you have an <strong>idea</strong> and want to know how to code it, I may not answer that immediately but note it down and we'll crack it later.</em></p></li>
<li><p>[x] Instead of asking people for <em>a / their favourite website</em>, just use Facebook and change its header <code>background</code> to demostrate that you can inspect&amp;tinker with any website.</p></li>
</ul>
