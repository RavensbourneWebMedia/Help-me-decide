		<h1>Presentation</h1>
		<h2>What is code?</h2>
		<p>It's <strong>instructions</strong> to a computer, your most pedantic friend.</p>
		<p>Code is executed by <strong>machines</strong>, and written by <strong>people</strong>.</p>
		<h2>Who is a coder?</h2>
		<p>Misconception: coding is for people who really know what they're doing, who have code just flowing out of their brains..</p>
		<p>A coder is someone like me (I'm no computer scientist), <strong>someone like you</strong>.</p>
		<p>Anyone who uses code to <strong>solve problems</strong>, <em>creatively</em> and <em>collaboratively</em>.</p>
		<h2>How do you learn to code?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Any ideas?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Like <strong>learning a new language</strong>, <strong>translating</strong> your ideas into code.</p>
		<h3>Copy</h3>
		<p>If you want to learn typography, you start copying and <strong>editing</strong> fonts.</p>
		<p>If you want to become a pattern cutter, you <strong>deconstruct</strong> and copy good garments.</p>
		<p>If you want to make things on the Web, you <strong>inspect</strong> and copy good websites.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>What's your favourite website?</li>
			<li>Let's <strong>inspect</strong> it.</li>
			<li>Let's <strong>hack</strong> it.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This is something we're going to dig in later on.</p>
		<h2>Can you learn to code in a day?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>What do you think?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Today is not about becoming proficient coders (although this could be your starting point), but rather to become <strong>confident in tinkering with code</strong>.</p>
		<p>To see code as a <strong>toolbox</strong>, and not something scary or too complex for you.</p>
		<p>To see the <strong>Web</strong> as a place where you can <strong>make</strong> things and not just <strong>consume</strong> them.</p>
		<h2>Today</h2>
		<p>You will make a <strong>Web comic</strong>.</p>
		<p>I will show you the <strong>building blocks</strong> of a Web page, and the bb of a comic.</p>
		<p>Then you will explore the potential of the Web, and experiment with the visual language of a comic.</p>
		<p>It will be up to you to <em>fill in the gaps</em>, and bring your Web comic to life.</p>
		<h2>What is a Web comic?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Any ideas?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>(conservative) It's a comic, on the Web.</p>
		<p>It's <strong>more</strong> than that.</p>
		<h2>What is a Web (comic)?</h2>
		<p>The Web is not the Internet. If the Internet is a global <em>brain</em> (infrastructure), the Web is all the <em>memories</em> and <em>thoughts</em> that run on top o it.</p>
		<p>The WWW started as a bunch of images and text linked together.
		A special kind of text, aka <strong>hypertext</strong> because it's linked together by <strong>hyperlinks</strong>.</p>
		<h2>How does the WWW work?</h2>
		<p>(Image of <em>browser</em> and <em>server</em>, with <em>HTTP</em> and <em>HTML</em> in between)</p>
		<p>The <strong>browser</strong>** is your waiter, takes an HTTP request from you and sends it to the Internet, to find a resource/page/site that responds to your request.</p>
		<p>If you haven't mistyped your request, this will reach a server on the other end.</p>
		<p>A <strong>server</strong> is a computer that is always on. Receives requests and cooks responses, which are sent back to the browser as <strong>HTML code</strong>.</p>
		<h3>HTML</h3>
		<p>What does HTML stand for?</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Any ideas?</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Markup</strong> is the key word here.</p>
		<p>As humans we understand information visually (eg big/small text in a magazine), but computers/browsers don't. So we need to <strong>mark our content up</strong>, ie tell the browser "This is an image, this a paragraph, this is a title, this is a section etc."</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;I am bold&lt;/p&gt;
then
&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
		<p>Anything between angle brackets is instructions for the browser.</p>
		<p>P is a shortcut for <em>paragraph</em>.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>What other tags do you know?</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>What is a (Web) comic?</h2>
		<p>It's a <strong>sequence</strong> of images and text that are <em>linked</em> together (bit like the Web).</p>
		<p>Mostly to tell a <strong>story</strong> (starts somewhere sometimes, things happen, happy or sad ending).</p>
		<h3>What is your story?</h3>
		<p>(link back to the Passport / Self brief)</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Who are you?</li>
			<li>What interests you?</li>
			<li>What do you stand for?</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>What is a/your Web comic?</h2>
		<p>What <strong>can</strong> a Wc be?</p>
		<p>On the Web, you can embed video, audio, animation, interactive objects (e.g. maps, drawing canvas), social media feeds and buttons...</p>
		<p>A comic is <em>not just</em> about telling stories: communicate ideas, express opinions, raise awareness, present projects..</p>
		<p>Your Web comic could become a storyboard, a lookbook, and interactive poster, an online magazine, a blog post. It’s really up to you.</p>
		<h2>Become Web-literate</h2>
		<p>By making a Web comic today, you will get to know the fabrics of the Web (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), and become confident to use code to <strong>express your ideas creatively</strong>.</p>
		<p>Today is about becoming Web-literate. I don't expect you to become a skilled coder. You may want to become a fashion designer, or a ...</p>
		<p>However as a <em>creative professional in the 21st century</em>, you can’t be Web-illiterate. Just like you have to be able to read and write, and do some maths. You need to understand a bit of code.</p>
		<p>Being Web-literate will enable you to use the Web as an open platform, a place where you can be a <strong>maker</strong>, instead of a <strong>consumer</strong>.</p>
		<p>Start <strong>creating and curating your own Web presence</strong>. Establish your voice online.</p>
