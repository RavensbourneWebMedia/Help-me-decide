## Creative coding

Today we're getting **creative** with **code**.

For many of you, this will be a **memorable day**! You'll write your **first line of code**, and by mid-afternoon you'll have made **your very own app**, from **scratch**!

Exciting, **fun**!

*On a practical note*, our **schedule** is.. we will have **breaks** at around 11:30 (half an hour) and 13:30 (1 hour)


## Two words about myself


## What is code?

**Why** do we need code? What is code used for? Who or what runs code? **Where** is code?

Code existed before computers (think *Morse code*, *post code*, *dress code*).

Code is about **communication**. If I want to talk to my **grandma**, I need to use Italian. To communicate with you, I use English. To **talk to a computer**, I use..

It's **instructions** to a computer: extremely powerful, fundamentally thick.

Imagine a computer is your most pedantic **friend**: 

* **break down** every step
* be **precise**
* it will take you **literally**

### Spot the difference

To realise the level of precision and **pedantry** your digital friend requires.

- [x] But we're using [SLIM](http://slim-lang.com/) right? So does it make sense to show *real* HTML?


## What are computers good at?

COMPUTERS → **Computing** (calculating very fast, comparing quantities), **repeating** (boring) tasks endlessly, **executing** instructions, **storing** data. 

### What are you good at?	

PEOPLE → **Spotting patterns** (connecting the dots), thinking **outside the box**, **inventing** new tools and new ways to use old **tools**.

**Code is a tool**, is how we can get computers to do the **heavy lifting for us**, so that we can focus on being **creative**.

PEOPLE are **good at writing code**.


## Are you a coder?	

### Who makes code?

**Misconception**: coding is for people who really know what they're doing, who have code just flowing out of their brains..

Anyone who uses code to **solve problems or make things**, *creatively* and *collaboratively*.

A coder is someone like me, someone like you. **I'm no computer scientist**.


## How do you learn to code?

Like **learning a new language**, **translating** your ideas into code.

**Today** you're going to learn **3 new languages**.

A bit of **grammar** and **vocabulary**, and mostly you can learn by **copying**.


## Copy + hack

To learn typography, you copy and **edit** fonts. 

To become a pattern cutter, you **deconstruct** and copy good garments.

To make things on the Web, you **inspect** and copy good websites.

**Today** you're going to **copy me** for a bit, then **hack** what you've copied into something **new**.


## Today

Joke about making a *relational database*

You will make an **app**.  

I will show you a few **coding tricks** and we'll lay the **foundations** of your app together. 

Then you will explore the **potential of the Web** as an open platform for you to **express your creativity**.


## What is the Web?

The Web is not the Internet. If the Internet is a global **brain** (infrastructure), the Web is all the **memories and thoughts** that run on top of it.

The WWW started as a way of **linking** academic documents together, over **2 computers in Switzerland**. 

TBL → **hypertext + Internet = WWW**, he specified a set of **rules** (HTTP) for computers to exchange documents over the Internet, and a standard **format** for these documents (HTML). 


## How does it WWWork?

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baddeo/creative-coding/master/RESTaurant/http.png)

The **browser** takes an HTTP request from you and sends it to the Internet, to find a resource/page/site that responds to your request.

If you haven't mistyped your request, this will reach a server on the other end.

A **server** is a computer that is always on. Receives requests and cooks responses, which are sent back to the browser as **HTML+CSS+JS code**.

**RESTaurant analogy**. Sometimes (in the old days) the server sends back a **cooked meal**, in most cases it sends back a list of **ingredients** and a **recipe**.


## HTML + CSS + JavaScript

Different **languages**, different **concerns** (or jobs/purposes)

HTML → structure and content 

CSS → style and design 

JS → behaviour and logic

**RECIPE analogy** (ingredients - serving suggestions - method)

(what - how - when/if)


## Become Web-literate

By making an app today, you will get to know the **fabrics** of the Web (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), and become **confident** to use code to **express your ideas creatively**.

Today is not about becoming proficient coders (although this could be your starting point), but rather to become **confident in tinkering with code**. To see code as a **toolbox**, and not something **scary** or too **complex**.

You may want to become a fashion designer, or a (ask)? However as a **creative professional in the 21st century you can’t be Web-illiterate**. Just like you have to be able to read and write, and do some maths. You need to understand a bit of code. 

Being Web-literate will enable you to use the Web as an **open platform**, a place where you can be a **maker**, instead of a **consumer**. 


## Open what?

The Web is full of resources: **open-source** code and **open data** that you can use to make amazing apps!

* Free? Why? It's **sharing** more than *giving away*.
* What is **open-source**? Libraries (eg: [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery), [Reveal.JS](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/)), GitHub, reputation economy..
* What is **open data**? APIs, WikiPedia


## Your brief

Make an app that helps people **make a decision**.

The app must take in some human **input**, use **code** to manipulate it, and then present a human-readable **output**.

You can use **data** from the Web to help people make a decision.

Eg: you can use **[weather data](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api)** to help people decide if they should take an umbrella or not. Or you can use **[unistats](http://unistats.direct.gov.uk/) data** to help people decide what university they should apply for.

## Robot time!

Let's pretend I'm a **robot** and you have to **code me**.

* **Mission**: find an object in the room, pick it up.
* I only understand these **commands**: `walk(steps)` and `turn(degrees)`
* I can asnwer **questions**, only with a `yes` or `no`

People usually start by giving you very *specific instructions* (eg: walk 3 steps, turn 45 degrees, walk 2 steps..)

We can then make them their code more *abstract* and *flexible* with **logic** and **functions**.


* [ ] Slide to show the game rules	
	
(The idea is to engage people with an [easy task](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/08/31/0956797612446024.abstract) before we challenge them with a demanding one)
	

## Let's talk about POP

Principles of Programming

Before we start coding the **behaviour** of our app, let's pretend that I'm a **robot** and you need to code me.

**Building blocks**

* Data → Variables **nouns**
* Actions → Functions **verbs**
* Decisions → Logic **conjunctions**
