# Presentation

## What is code?

**Where** is code? Is there code in this (phone/computer/presentation..)

It's **instructions** to a computer: extremely powerful, fundamentally thick. 

Imagine a computer is your most pedantic **friend**: 

* **break down** every step
* be **precise**
* it will take you **literally**

### Spot the difference


## What are computers good at?

**Computing** (calculating very fast, comparing quantities), **repeating** (boring) tasks endlessly, **executing** instructions, **storing** data. 

### What are you good at?	

People are good at **spotting patterns** (connecting the dots), thinking **outside the box**, **inventing** new tools and new ways to use old tools.

**Code is a tool**, is how we can get computers to do the **heavy lifting for us**, so that we can focus on the creative aspects of computing.


## Who is a coder?	

### Who makes code?

Code is executed by **machines**, and written by **people**.

Misconception: coding is for people who really know what they're doing, who have code just flowing out of their brains..

Anyone who uses code to **solve problems or make things**, *creatively* and *collaboratively*.

A coder is someone like me, someone like you. **I'm no computer scientist**.


## How do you learn to code?

Like **learning a new language**, **translating** your ideas into code.

**Today** you're going to learn **2 new languages**.

A bit of **grammar** and **vocabulary**, and mostly you can learn by **copying**.

### Copy

To learn typography, you copy and **edit** fonts. 

To become a pattern cutter, you **deconstruct** and copy good garments.

To make things on the Web, you **inspect** and copy good websites.

**Today** you're going to **copy me** before lunch, **hack it** after lunch.


## Today

You will make a **Web comic**. 

I will show you a few **coding tricks** and we'll lay the **foundations** of your Web comic together. 

Then you will explore the **potential of the Web**, and experiment with the **visual language** of a comic.

It will be up to you to *fill in the gaps*, and bring your Web comic to life.

## What is a Web comic?

* Any ideas?

It's a comic, on the Web... right? It's **more** than a standard printed comic, put on the Web. 

## What is a Web (comic)?

The Web is not the Internet. If the Internet is a global **brain** (infrastructure), the Web is all the **memories and thoughts** that run on top of it.

The WWW started as a way of **linking** scientific documents together, over **2 computers in Switzerland**. 

TBL → **hypertext + Internet = WWW**, he specified a set of **rules** (HTTP) for computers to exchange documents over the Internet, and a standard **format** for these documents (HTML). 


## How does the WWW work?

(Image of *browser* and *server*, with *HTTP* and *HTML* in between)

The **browser** is your waiter, takes an HTTP request from you and sends it to the Internet, to find a resource/page/site that responds to your request.

If you haven't mistyped your request, this will reach a server on the other end.

A **server** is a computer that is always on. Receives requests and cooks responses, which are sent back to the browser as **HTML code**. 


### HTML

What does HTML stand for? 

* Any ideas?

**Markup** is the key word here.

As humans we **understand information visually** (eg big/small text in a magazine), but computers/browsers don't. So we need to **mark our content up**, ie tell the browser "This is an image, this a paragraph, this is a title, this is a section etc."

    <p>Follow me on Twitter</p>
    
    then
    
    <p><a href="//twitter.com/baddeo">Follow me on Twitter</a></p>
    
Anything between angle brackets is instructions for the browser.

Use the **sandwich analogy** to explain html tags.


## What is a (Web) comic?

It's a **sequence** of images and text that are **linked** together (bit like the Web). 

Mostly to tell a **story** (starts somewhere sometimes, things happen, happy or sad ending).
 
### What is your story? 

* Who are you? 
* What interests you? 
* What do you stand for?

## What is a/your Web comic?

On the **Web**, you can have **more** than images and text: embed video, audio & animation, you can get people to **draw** instead of just **read** (e.g. maps, drawing canvas), social media feeds and buttons... 

A **comic is *not just* about telling stories**: communicate **ideas**, express **opinions**, raise **awareness**, present **projects**..

Your Web comic could become a **storyboard**, a **lookbook**, and **interactive poster**, an online **magazine**, a blog **post**. It’s really up to you.

## Become Web-literate

By making a Web comic today, you will get to know the **fabrics** of the Web (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), and become **confident** to use code to **express your ideas creatively**.

Today is not about becoming proficient coders (although this could be your starting point), but rather to become **confident in tinkering with code**. To see code as a **toolbox**, and not something **scary** or too **complex**.

You may want to become a fashion designer, or a (ask)? However as a **creative professional in the 21st century you can’t be Web-illiterate**. Just like you have to be able to read and write, and do some maths. You need to understand a bit of code. 

Being Web-literate will enable you to use the Web as an open platform, a place where you can be a **maker**, instead of a **consumer**.

# Notes

##### 10.09

- Should explain the difference between HTML and CSS before we start coding? Maybe there should also be a slide for CSS?

- [x] Instead of `<b>` show `<a>`

- [x] *Spot the difference* at the beginning of the presentation, when talking about *what is code* and the pedantic friend analogy.
	
- [x] Do we need to end with the *Become Web-literate* slide? Or perhaps something more practical, like 

	*Go online, find Webmaker and sign in.*
	
- [x] Instead of asking people for *a / their favourite website*, just use Facebook and change its header `background` to demostrate that you can inspect&tinker with any website.

##### 16.09

- [x] What are computers good at, what are you good at?
- [x] Spot the difference with `src-scr`
- [x] Remove Facebook hack (can show that at the beginning of the *Hacktivity*)
- [x] Copy (me) before lunch, hack it after lunch
- [x] Re-jig *What is the Web?* slide
- [x] Remove *Can you learn to code in a day?* slide
- [] *Anatomy* of a comic
