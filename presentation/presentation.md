## What is code?

It's **instructions** to a computer, your most pedantic friend.

Code is executed by **machines**, and written by **people**.

## Who is a coder?	

Misconception: coding is for people who really know what they're doing, who have code just flowing out of their brains..

A coder is someone like me (I'm no computer scientist), **someone like you**.

Anyone who uses code to **solve problems**, *creatively* and *collaboratively*.

## How do you learn to code?

* Any ideas?

Like **learning a new language**, **translating** your ideas into code.

### Copy

If you want to learn typography, you start copying and **editing** fonts. 

If you want to become a pattern cutter, you **deconstruct** and copy good garments.

If you want to make things on the Web, you **inspect** and copy good websites.

* What's your favourite website? 
* Let's **inspect** it. 
* Let's **hack** it.

This is something we're going to dig in later on.


## Can you learn to code in a day?

* What do you think?

Today is not about becoming proficient coders (although this could be your starting point), but rather to become **confident in tinkering with code**. 

To see code as a **toolbox**, and not something scary or too complex for you.

To see the **Web** as a place where you can **make** things and not just **consume** them. 

## Today

You will make a **Web comic**. 

I will show you the **building blocks** of a Web page, and the bb of a comic.

Then you will explore the potential of the Web, and experiment with the visual language of a comic.

It will be up to you to *fill in the gaps*, and bring your Web comic to life.

## What is a Web comic?

* Any ideas?

(conservative) It's a comic, on the Web.

It's **more** than that. 

## What is a Web (comic)?

The Web is not the Internet. If the Internet is a global *brain* (infrastructure), the Web is all the *memories* and *thoughts* that run on top o it.

The WWW started as a bunch of images and text linked together. 
A special kind of text, aka **hypertext** because it's linked together by **hyperlinks**.

## How does the WWW work?

(Image of *browser* and *server*, with *HTTP* and *HTML* in between)

The **browser**** is your waiter, takes an HTTP request from you and sends it to the Internet, to find a resource/page/site that responds to your request.

If you haven't mistyped your request, this will reach a server on the other end.

A **server** is a computer that is always on. Receives requests and cooks responses, which are sent back to the browser as **HTML code**. 


### HTML

What does HTML stand for? 

* Any ideas?

**Markup** is the key word here.

As humans we understand information visually (eg big/small text in a magazine), but computers/browsers don't. So we need to **mark our content up**, ie tell the browser "This is an image, this a paragraph, this is a title, this is a section etc."

    <p>I am bold</p>
    
    then
    
    <p>I am <b>bold</b> </p>
    
Anything between angle brackets is instructions for the browser.

P is a shortcut for *paragraph*.    
    
* What other tags do you know?

## What is a (Web) comic?

It's a **sequence** of images and text that are *linked* together (bit like the Web). 

Mostly to tell a **story** (starts somewhere sometimes, things happen, happy or sad ending).
 
### What is your story? 

(link back to the Passport / Self brief)

* Who are you? 
* What interests you? 
* What do you stand for?

## What is a/your Web comic?

What **can** a Wc be?

On the Web, you can embed video, audio, animation, interactive objects (e.g. maps, drawing canvas), social media feeds and buttons... 

A comic is *not just* about telling stories: communicate ideas, express opinions, raise awareness, present projects..

Your Web comic could become a storyboard, a lookbook, and interactive poster, an online magazine, a blog post. It’s really up to you.

## Become Web-literate

By making a Web comic today, you will get to know the fabrics of the Web (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), and become confident to use code to **express your ideas creatively**.

Today is about becoming Web-literate. I don't expect you to become a skilled coder. You may want to become a fashion designer, or a ...

However as a *creative professional in the 21st century*, you can’t be Web-illiterate. Just like you have to be able to read and write, and do some maths. You need to understand a bit of code. 

Being Web-literate will enable you to use the Web as an open platform, a place where you can be a **maker**, instead of a **consumer**. 

Start **creating and curating your own Web presence**. Establish your voice online.
